PvPuino - A top down PvP game for Arduino. Features 360 degree moving and shooting, five different maps to play on, and powerups that are sure to make every game wild! Playtesting has shown this game to be difficult to put down.

Compiling Instructions:

From the pvpuino directory do

$ make

to build, or

$ make upload

to build and upload to a connected Arduino.

Software Specifications:

The Arduino standard libraries, as well as the Adafruit GFX libraries (Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_ST7735) are required to build this project.

The project itself is made up of several files:

collide - most of the collision checking code
draw - defines walls and display settings, and contains the code for spawning new projectiles and updating the screen
joystick - gets joystick input
menu - defines all of the menu layouts, and new game init code
player - defines the player struct
power - defines, draws, spawns, applies and updates powerup effects
projectile - defines projectiles
sound - defines the game’s sound effects that are called mostly by menu and powerup

and finally,
pvpuino - the main file for starting up the game, and contains the game loop

Hardware Specifications:

This program is designed for use with two breadboards. Breadboard 1 will represent the breadboard attached to the Arduino, and breadboard 2 will represent an independent breadboard wired to the same Arduino. The pin placement of the joysticks on the breadboard are not required to be the exact ones written here, but this is the configuration we came up with. We’ve also included some wiring diagrams of a similar configuration.

Breadboard Configuration:
One wire connecting the 5V pin on the Arduino to pin 1 on the power bus of breadboard 1
One wire connecting the first ground pin on the Arduino to pin 2 on the ground bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin 3 of the power bus on breadboard 1 to pin 1 of the power bus on breadboard 2
One wire connecting pin 4 of the ground bus on breadboard 1 to pin 2 of the ground bus on breadboard 2

Display Configuration:
The 10 display pins occupy pins A45-A54 on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin D45 on breadboard 1 to pin 29 on the power bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin E46 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 50 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D47 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 52 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin E48 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 51 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D49 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 6 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin E50 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 5 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D51 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 7 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin E52 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 8 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D53 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 49 on the power bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin E54 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 50 on the ground bus on breadboard 1

Speaker Configuration:
One wire connecting pin C10 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 10 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin C12 on breadboard 1 to pin 14 on the ground bus on breadboard 1

Joystick Configuration:

Player One's Move Joystick:
The 5 joystick pins occupy pins E59-E63 on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin C59 on breadboard 1 to pin 47 on the power bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin B60 on breadboard 1 to analog pin 1 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin C61 on breadboard 1 to analog pin 0 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin B62 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 2 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin C63 on breadboard 1 to pin 48 on the ground bus on breadboard 1

Player One's Shoot Joystick:
The 5 joystick pins occupy pins E30-E34 on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin C30 on breadboard 1 to pin 20 on the power bus on breadboard 1

One wire connecting pin C61 on breadboard 2 to analog pin 4 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin C63 on breadboard 2 to pin 48 on the ground bus on breadboard 2

Player Two's Shoot Joystick:
The 5 joystick pins occupy pins E30-E34 on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin C30 on breadboard 2 to pin 20 on the power bus on breadboard 2
One wire connecting pin B31 on breadboard 2 to analog pin 7 on the Arduino
