Hardware Specifications:

This program is designed for use with two breadboards. Breadboard 1 will represent the breadboard attached to the arduino, and breadboard 2 will represent an independent breadboard wired to the same arduino.

Breadboard Configuration:
One wire connecting the 5V pin on the Arduino to pin 1 on the power bus of breadboard 1
One wire connecting the first ground pin on the Ardiuno to pin 2 on the ground bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin 3 of the power bus on breadboard 1 to pin 1 of the power bus on breadboard 2
One wire connecting pin 4 of the ground bus on breadboard 1 to pin 2 of the ground bus on breadboard 2

Display Configuration:
The 10 display pins occupy pins A45-A54 on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin D45 on breadboard 1 to pin 29 on the power bus on breadboard 1
One wire connecting pin E46 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 50 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D47 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 52 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin E48 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 51 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D49 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 6 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin E50 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 5 on the Arduino
One wire connecting pin D51 on breadboard 1 to digital pin 7 on the Arduino
